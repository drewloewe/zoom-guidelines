# Zoom guidelines for Prof. Loewe's classes

These guidelines are a work in progress. We are all works in progress.

### Q:  What is the dress code?
*   A:  Please wear clothing of some sort.

### Q:  Do I need to "curate" my Zoom background for a professional appearance?
*   A:  No. Our class meetings are not job interviews. A lot of the high-handed advice given to students on this score is officious and rather silly. A good rule of thumb is this: don't have anything visible around you that you would not want others to see, but if you have piles of laundry, etc., we will conclude merely that you are a person with a life, so you don't need to stage your room as if it were some *House Hunters* clip. I use a Zoom virtual background, but you do not have to (they increase bandwidth use).

### Q:  May I eat or drink during class?
*   A:  Do what you need to do. I usually have a coffee or water handy. Pro tips: mute your mic when eating/drinking, use a cup with a lid, so you don't accidentally ruin your computer.

### Q:  What if I don't want to be on camera?
*   A:  I'm leaving that up to you. You will have to participate actively, but there are ways to do that besides staring into a webcam for 75 minutes. You might also toggle between on-camera and off-camera, as I sometimes do (e.g., if I have to sneeze). 

### Q:  Should I mute my mic?
*   A:  When you join the whole-class meeting, your mic will be muted. Turn it on to speak. When you are not speaking in the meeting, please mute your mic (that avoids feedback, distractions, etc.). My dog is likely to bark at times, I have kids, etc., so I may mute my mic from time to time, too. When you are in a breakout room, you should leave your mic active since it'll be a much smaller setting and it would be tedious to keep turning it on and off. 

### Q:  How can I participate actively on Zoom?
*   A:  Participate in polls or shared Google docs, use the "raise hand" feature, talk/do the assigned work in breakout rooms, use the chat feature, etc. I often use the chat feature in the many meetings that I attend to ask questions or add to a point that someone is making orally. I have a three-monitor setup in my home office, so I will keep an eye on chat and incorporate it in our discussions. You may also be required at times to post something in chat.

### Q: What if I have a weak WiFi connection?
*   A: Turning off video can sometimes help to ease bandwidth load. Chat is also a low-bandwidth function. The occasional glitch is all but inevitable, even under the best of conditions. I have good WiFi at home, but my wife and kids will be online at the same time, so my connection may not always be 100% solid. We'll adapt.

### Q: What if the class meeting goes down (WiFi/power outage from storms, e.g.)?
*   A: We will adapt. Give me ten minutes or so to figure something out and try to get everything running again. I may mass-email the class with instructions for what to do. Don't assume that the class is over unless I say so, but we will adapt and get through it. If the class is totally taken out, I'll make sure that you get what you need, by hook or by crook.

### Q: How are you protecting my privacy in class and in visiting hours?
*   A: This question brings up several related issues: 

1) *Basic setup*-- I will be in a room with a closed door and will use headphones, so anything that you say will not be audible to outsiders. 
2) *Zoom recordings*-- I choose not to record our sessions by default. If you have a 504 accomodation that allows you to record sessions, I will of course support you, but please discuss it with me. Zoom allows participants to record if the host gives them permission, but you'll need to discuss the accommodation with me so we can make sure a) that it works for you and b) whether there's a less-intrusive way to get the benefit of the recording (e.g., recording audio with your phone or other means).
3) *Zoom chat*-- I will probably save and share the Zoom chat transcripts becuse they are a good record of questions and I may require you, e.g., in breakout groups, to post items to the chat for the whole class to work through. Chat transcripts are far less intrusive than recordings. I may also write things in chat that emerge from discussions (or ask you to), just as a way to capture something important, offer some bit of advice, or deal with a Wi-Fi hiccup. The chat transcripts are simple time-stamped text files that have participant's names on them. Please be aware that private chats are not necessarily private in Zoom. Don't write anything in a Zoom chat that you would not feel comfortable sharing with the whole class.

### Q: How will I know when the class session is over? 
*   A: I will tell you. Please don't do the digital equivalent of that thing in F2F classes where students sometimes start packing up five minutes early. We will not run over the alotted time, but we may work right up until the last minute (or not--it depends). When the meeting is over, I will tell you unambiguously. Then we can all sign off awkwardly, waving like Muppets, doing jazz hands, or using some other convention that we work out.
